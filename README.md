# Gender-Based-Analysis
Gender - Based Analysis (investments) using Power Bi
**Overview and Purpose**
This repository contains the interactive data model and visualizations for the Gender Analysis Project. The core objective is to leverage robust data analysis and visualization techniques to understand, assess, and benchmark gender distribution, representation, and equity across a specific domain (e.g., organizational structure, customer demographics, or academic performance).
This transparency is crucial for any organization committed to fairness and equitable practices. The core deliverable, Gender analysis.pbix, provides a dynamic, user-friendly interface for exploring complex gender-related metrics. 
It allows stakeholders to move beyond anecdotal evidence, offering verifiable, data-driven insights essential for strategic planning, targeted intervention initiatives, and tracking progress toward diversity goals.
**Data and Methodology**
The Power BI data model is built upon a curated, historical dataset (likely sourced from HR records, survey results, or public sector information), ensuring the metrics are grounded in verifiable facts.
The model utilizes a robust star or snowflake schema and features a series of calculated measures written in Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to quantify key aspects of gender distribution and equity across the data.
**Key Analytical Areas:**
**Distribution:** Detailed visualizations showing the gender split across critical variables, including organizational hierarchy (job titles, management levels), functional areas (departments), and geographic regions. This provides a comprehensive map of representation across the entire structure.
****Equity Metrics:** **Sophisticated calculated fields measuring potential disparities, such as salary comparisons (analyzing mean and median compensation for equivalent roles), promotion rates, retention rates, and the critical assessment of representation in executive and board-level leadership roles.
**Trends:** In-depth time-series analysis to track changes in representation over quarterly and annual periods, allowing for the comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness and impact of implemented diversity and inclusion programs.
The entire analytical approach emphasizes factual, unbiased visualization to establish a clear, objective baseline for current performance and immediately highlight areas where intervention or further deep-dive analysis is critically warranted.

The Gender analysis.pbix file contains a set of polished, interactive dashboards designed for both high-level summaries and detailed exploration. The dashboards allow real-time filtering by time, department, and seniority, enabling users to drill down into specific areas of concern.
